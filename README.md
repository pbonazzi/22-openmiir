# Description

For passion, I did some work on an EEG datasets. Espacially, I have tried to predict which songs participants where listening to, directly from their EEG waves. I also tested if I was able to classify the task participants were up to (prediction of song vs imagination of a song).

Finally, I have tested the performance in both tasks using data from only the temporal lobe vs the whole headset.

# Data

This experiment uses the public domain [OpenMIIR dataset](https://github.com/sstober/openmiir), revised and extended version of an experiment originally described in [Sebastian Stober; Avital Sternin; Adrian M. Owen & Jessica A. Grahn: *Deep Feature Learning for EEG Recordings.* In: arXiv preprint arXiv:1511.04306 2015.](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04306) . 


## After thoughts

I did this project in 2 days and the dataset I found was small. 
In other scenarios, I will have used ensamble methods, SVM, convolution or Transformer.
